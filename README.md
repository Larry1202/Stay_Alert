# Stay_Alert
The objective of this project is to design a detector/classifier that will detect whether the driver is alert or not alert, employing any combination of vehicular, environmental and driver physiological data that are acquired while driving.

To view the project, download the files and either upload it on google collab or view it in any code editors like visual studio code.
